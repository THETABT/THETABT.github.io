				<p>
					I've played many different types of video games. There's only a couple that I've finished though.
					Mostly on the computer is where I play my video games. I like consoles though more because of the controllers.
					Computers can use controllers too, so I like them more. I like the gaming culture, retro, Mario, Link, the feeling.

					I like comic books too. My collection is about 30 comics. My favourite characters are the big ones like
					Superman, Spider-Man, Wolverine, Captain America. I also like the ones that not a lot people know.
					Like Superman from Earth 6. My favourite character usually depends on my mood though. I have to get in
					the feeling of Superman in order to like Superman.
